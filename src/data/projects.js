        paragraph: `Forecasting future events requires reasoning under uncertainty and timely use of external information. The rise of large language models (LLMs) makes scalable forecasting possible, as they have access to massive context. Yet most evaluations rely on retrospective data—questions whose outcomes were likely present in pretraining corpora—blurring whether models truly reason about the future or simply recall what they have seen.

We introduce a clean-slate, forward-only evaluation protocol and benchmark that precludes retrospective contamination. Both training and test sets are restricted to forecasting questions posted after a model's knowledge cutoff. We release versioned, frozen snapshots of prediction-market questions along with time-stamped web search reports captured at scrape time—after the model's cutoff but before resolution. These snapshots enable forward-only backtesting to evaluate various strategies of prompting and retrieval, and exact replication even after markets resolve.

Using a random sample of 1,000 questions, we run two experiments. (1) Retrieval: retrieval-augmented LLMs outperform no-retrieval LLMs and demonstrate that access to web search results evidence improves predictive accuracy. (2) Granularity: leveraging the benchmark's hierarchical structure, event-level prompting yields higher accuracy than market-level prompting.`,

In this paper, we review existing evaluation methods, highlight limitations, and argue that AI safety research should incorporate human-centered evaluations that measure harmful capability uplift—the marginal increase in a user's ability to cause harm with a frontier model beyond what conventional tools already enable. Drawing on nascent work in this area, we position harmful capability uplift as a foundational consideration for AI safety, ground it in prior research, and provide concrete methodological guidance for systematic evaluation. We conclude with actionable implementation steps for developers, researchers, funders, and regulators to make harmful capability uplift evaluation a standard practice alongside traditional benchmarks.`,

Using a two-step method combining graph-based community detection and guided Latent Dirichlet Allocation, we identify nine user roles and track their post-ChatGPT engagement. A differences-in-differences analysis comparing each group with a matched control suggests heterogeneous trajectories.`,

This study investigates the impact of advancing AI capabilities on human-AI collaboration in the domain of short romance story writing. We evaluated three AI models—GPT-2, GPT-3, and GPT-4—across four conditions: human-only writing, AI-only writing, human revision of AI-generated stories, and human selection of AI-generated stories. Results reveal that GPT-2 alone does not achieve acceptable story quality, and with GPT-2, human-AI collaboration fails to yield significant benefits. In contrast, GPT-3 demonstrates the value of human-AI synergy: collaborative approaches outperform humans alone, with the Selection condition improving both speed and quality and the Revision condition offering better story quality. However, GPT-3 alone still falls short of producing stories of acceptable quality. GPT-4 represents a transformative leap, as it independently generates stories of acceptable quality at a much higher speed than humans. Thus, GPT-4 alone surpasses both humans alone and combinations of humans and GPT-4. These findings underscore the dynamic nature of human-AI synergy, illustrating how the balance of contributions shifts as AI capabilities improve.`,

Extending from our initial formative study, which revealed challenges in human utilization of conversational AI support, we designed two configurations for prompt guidance: a Nudging approach, where the AI suggests potential responses for human agents, and a Highlight strategy, emphasizing crucial parts of reference documents to aid human responses. Through two controlled experiments, the first involving 31 participants and the second involving 106 participants, we compared these configurations against traditional human-only approaches, both with and without AI assistance. Our findings suggest that effective human-AI collaboration can enhance response quality, though merely combining human and AI efforts does not ensure improved outcomes. In particular, the Nudging configuration was shown to help improve the quality of the output when compared to AI alone. This paper delves into the development of these prompt guidance paradigms, offering insights for refining human-AI collaborations in conversational question-answering contexts and contributing to a broader understanding of human perceptions and expectations in AI partnerships.`,

With the initial prototype, we conducted a formative study (N=10) and identified the potential benefits and risks of such an adaptive scheduling tool. Then, after enhancing the system, we conducted two controlled experiments, one each for attendees and organizers (total N=66). For each experiment, we compared scheduling with verbal messages, shared calendars, or Togedule. Results show that Togedule significantly reduces the cognitive load of attendees indicating their availability and improves the speed and quality of the decisions made by organizers.`,

Here, we show how to perform such a test using the ratio of means as a measure of effect size. Then we demonstrate the use of this test in three ways. First, in an analysis of 79 recently published experimental results, we find that, surprisingly, over half of the studies find a decrease in performance, the mean and median ratios of performance improvement are both approximately 1 (corresponding to no improvement at all), and the maximum ratio is 1.36 (a 36% improvement). Second, we experimentally investigate whether a higher performance improvement ratio is obtained when 100 human programmers generate software using GPT-3, a massive, state-of-the-art AI system. In this case, we find a speed improvement ratio of 1.27 (a 27% improvement). Finally, we find that 50 human non-programmers using GPT-3 can perform the task about as well as--and less expensively than--the human programmers. In this case, neither the non-programmers nor the computer would have been able to perform the task alone, so this is an example of a very strong form of human-computer synergy.`,

            "Virtual academic networking is socio-technically challenging, however, fruitful for researchers' success. We introduce a system called Who2chat to tackle the challenge and facilitate connections of researchers in virtual social hours. Who2chat allows academic researchers to create a research profile and express their research interests, find researchers with similar interests, overcome social barriers, and coordinate and start video chats, all within a single interface. We engaged in an iterative design process by deploying Who2chat at academic conferences. In our preliminary deployment (N=80), we found that researchers often have difficulty finding other researchers who share similar interests, and they are shy about reaching out to other researchers. Inspired by this, we implemented social-signaling features to Who2chat and ran our first deployment (N=220). Our results highlight that the interface allowed users to find relevant researchers and helped them feel confident in joining conversations. However, this led to large group conversations where discussion topics were more superficial. In response, we developed and deployed our second interface (N=81). Key improvements were managing the size of conversations, dynamically determining and allowing individuals to join a conversation based on their relevance to the ongoing discussion, and maintaining the ratio of senior and junior members, to further enhance the quality of discussions. As a result, participants were able to meet more people and engage in more meaningful conversations. Our work demonstrates an interface design for social networking in academic settings and how to lower social barriers in virtual networking.",

Advances in AI sought to ease these burdens by automating aspects of the process. However, little is known about how different forms of AI assistance shape usability and learning. In this paper, we introduce Noteworthy, a note-taking system that leverages large language models to provide real-time autocomplete suggestions. In a controlled experiment with 30 participants, we compared three conditions: traditional note-taking (human-only), fully automated AI-generated notes (AI-only), and hybrid note-taking with Noteworthy. Results show that with Noteworthy, participants experienced less frustration and generated longer notes with lower physical load. However, these efficiency gains came at the cost of reduced learning outcomes compared to traditional note-taking. These findings suggest AI-assisted features may unintentionally hinder learning by making the process effortless. We discuss design suggestions for effortful AI to support usability while engaging users in cognitive processing.`,

We describe two studies of this system's use at two virtual conferences with over 450 total participants. Our results provide evidence for the usefulness of this capability, showing that, for example, 81% of people who used the system successfully thought that future virtual conferences should include a tool with similar functionality. We believe that similar functionality is likely to be widely implemented in many videoconferencing systems and to increase the feasibility and desirability of many kinds of remote work and socializing.",

On this basis, this study aimed to examine the internal regulatory processes based on Git and GitHub, which serve as such a mechanism, and redefine the efficiency of open source software projects to fully reflect them. For this purpose, a two-stage data envelopment analysis was used to measure the project efficiency reflecting the internal processes.

    //         "<strong>Introduction.</strong> Shashagungun is a platform for Seoul National University (SNU) students to share posters about school events such as market, daily pub, competitions, seminars, exhibitions, and so on. It was implemented by me and other 5 people, who were all members of a web programming club called <a target='_blank' href='https://snu.likelion.net'>Likelion</a>. We won <b>first place at a competition for developing a school-related service</b> held by <a target='_blank' href='https://snulife.com'>SNULife</a>, which is a web-based community for SNU students. Shashagungun is a coined term derived from Korean idiom 'Sasagungun (사사건건)' combined with 'Sha (샤)' that is symbolic of SNU.<br><br><strong>Motivation.</strong> My idea about Shashagungun started a long time ago. I used to design numerous posters, but as time passed, I felt bad about my posters stuck useless in my laptop -- not only mine, but many other high-quality posters lasting only for a short period and then thrown out to bin. <br><br> Furthermore, this was tragedy for not only the designers, but also students in general. Information on school events, particularly the unofficial ones held by students, was so unorganized that students often were confused or never found out the events. Something had to be done to get the posters organized in a single space. <br><br> So these are why I came up with the idea of bringing the posters online to create an online platform where (1) students can easily search and obtain information on school events, and (2) at the same time designers can preserve their precious efforts on the posters.",

To narrow down the scope of the topic, I tried to put emphasis on the question if the refugees are dangerous and likely to be involved in a crime in particular. I didn't explicitly answer the question, but instead tried to focus more on delivering the data itself so that the reader wouldn't feel that they are being forced to be on one side. One example is the case of Sweden in which I showed both increasing and decreasing crime rate due to accepting refugees. This implies that the number of refugees have nothing to do with the crime rate, showing neither positive nor negative correlation. <br><br> I spent a lot of time searching for factual data—I even read the German official police report using Google translation in order to keep the objectivity using the rawest data. Because of this, the resulting infographic was less visually engaging, and sometimes even misleading due to wrong usage of visual devices.<br><br>The infographic first points out what the people think about the refugees, which has also been a motivation for this project. Then, it points out how crime rate of refugees or foreigners are not so different from other people, giving example of Germany, Norway, and South Korea. Lastly, it suggests that maybe the reason for the difference between people's perspective and what data really says is partially because of what media highlight.",

    //         "<strong>About.</strong> I collected data of my friends at Facebook, friend lists of those friends, friend lists of those friends of friends, and so on—only up to 6 times. With this data, I found the shortest path within six degrees that starts from my direct friends and comes back to me on Facebook. Also, I collected data of recent closeness by combining the number of mentions each friend is mentioned in my recent SNS notifications with my subjective closeness. My intention was to briefly check the following two things - (1) Does the concept of “six degrees of Kevin Bacon” also apply to my relationships on Facebook? (2) Does the shortest path have any relationship with recent closeness? The answer for the first question was \"most of the time,\" since there were several exceptions. For the second question, the answer was definitely \"yes\", since there was a high correlation between recent closeness and the degree in the shortest path. I thought that my relationships are relatively distributed, because with the other person's data, I believe the results might have been much simpler ending up with only two or three degrees.<br><br><strong>How to Read.</strong> Each line coming straight out from the center of the circle represents my direct friend who is one degree away from me. The innermost part of the circle is recent closeness visualized as a line graph. Then, the innermost node refers to the friend of my friend, not my direct friend. So if the number of degrees is 2, the path is ‘my friend - friend's friend - me'. If the path was found within six degrees, the vertices and edges were colored gray, whereas if not, the vertices and edges were colored blue—the vertices of me myself were colored yellow. The dark blue zone corresponds to an infinite zone implying that the connection didn't come back to me yet.<br><br><img src='https://66.media.tumblr.com/7c68dfaf932ee05a0e085541a602eec4/tumblr_inline_pjzlchpmns1w8f964_540.gif' width='400'><br><br><strong>Implementation.</strong> For implementation, I used d3.js, which was also introduced in class by Professor Hong.
